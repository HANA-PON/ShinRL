# Overview

* **_calc** has common (jittable pure) functions in ShinRL (e.g., [`optimal_backup_dp`](/home/rl-dqn/ShinRL-JAX/shinrl/_calc/backup_dp.py))
* **_utils** has common useful functions or classes in ShinRL (e.g., [`Config`](/home/rl-dqn/ShinRL-JAX/shinrl/_utils/config.py))
* **envs** has implementations of `Shin` environments (e.g., [`ShinPendulum`](/home/rl-dqn/ShinRL-JAX/shinrl/envs/pendulum/env.py)).
* **solver** has implementations of algorithms (e.g., [`DiscreteViSolver`](/home/rl-dqn/ShinRL-JAX/shinrl/solvers/discrete_vi/solver.py)).
